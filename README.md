## Item View

Add images, ingredients, allergen information, mise/marking notes for front-of-house staff, and times the item is available.

Add notes to specific allergens to communicate what can be removed, substituted, etc. Fewer trips to the kitchen pass means more time with guests and greater menu confidence.
