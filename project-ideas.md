# Phase 5 Project Ideas

# -- Restaurant / Hospitality --

- Shiftnote with local storage
-- Quite doable, but interesting?


- Wine / menu education platform
-- Interesting material
-- Clear database structure

- Logistics app for CGS

# -- Transit --

- Where is my bus / train
-- Location query >> real time arrival data + other local stops
-- What would the backend look like; are the libraries there?
-- nyct-gtfs, underground --  python libs

- How is my commute today

# -- Other --

- Puerh tea tasting notes


# -- Less Feasible --

- Web-based POS
-- Hardware considerations

- Menu template tool
-- Challenging to render properly vs print- Hardware considerations
- Beverage inventory and cost tool
